{"name":"Clarity","tagline":"Dreamforce 2013","body":"Clarity is a mobile idea collaboration platform where brands can ask their customers (and employees), \"What product should we make next?\" and customers can share their ideas and get engaged. Spitfire Athlete built it over a few days for the 2013 Dreamforce hackathon.\r\n\r\nWith Clarity you can:\r\n\r\n* Create new projects\r\n* Browse and add ideas to existing projects\r\n* View project collaborators\r\n* Upvote / Downvote Ideas\r\n* Pull Brand information from your Salesforce Org\r\n\r\nClarity is ideal for marketing/PR firms and divisions of companies. A great future enhancement would include analytics of responses, and analysis of project contributions by customer demographic.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n@nidhik @neverbendeasy\r\n\r\nAPI hosted on Heroku.\r\n* http://clarityapi.herokuapp.com/\r\n* https://github.com/spitfireathlete/clarityAPI\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
